Dependencies for the Script

Your script uses the following libraries:

    Python: Base language (3.8–3.10 recommended for compatibility).
    pandas: For CSV handling.
    torch: PyTorch for GPU-accelerated tensor operations and model training.
    transformers: Hugging Face library for Whisper models and processor.
    datasets: Hugging Face library for dataset handling.
    torchaudio: For audio processing (loading WAV files, resampling).
    evaluate: For WER metric computation.
    jiwer: Dependency of evaluate for WER calculation (installed implicitly).
    numpy: Often required by PyTorch and other libraries.

Additional considerations:

    CUDA: PyTorch and torchaudio need GPU support matching your offline PC’s CUDA version (e.g., CUDA 11.8 or 12.1 for a 20GB GPU like an NVIDIA RTX 3090).
    Offline Model Download: Pre-download Whisper models (openai/whisper-large-v3, distil-whisper/distil-large-v3) and processor.

Step-by-Step Guide
1. Set Up Environment on Online PC

Create a Conda environment with all dependencies and export it.
bash
# Create a new Conda environment (use Python 3.10 for broad compatibility)
conda create -n asr_distillation python=3.10

# Activate the environment
conda activate asr_distillation

# Install PyTorch with CUDA support (adjust CUDA version based on offline GPU)
# For CUDA 11.8 (common for 20GB GPUs like RTX 3090)
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia

# Install Hugging Face libraries
conda install -c conda-forge transformers datasets

# Install additional dependencies
conda install -c conda-forge pandas evaluate

# Install jiwer (dependency for evaluate's WER metric)
conda install -c conda-forge jiwer

# Verify installations
python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__, torch.cuda.is_available())"
python -c "import transformers; print(transformers.__version__)"
python -c "import datasets; print(datasets.__version__)"
python -c "import torchaudio; print(torchaudio.__version__)"
python -c "import evaluate; print(evaluate.__version__)"
2. Pre-Download Models and Processor

Since the offline PC won’t have internet, download the models and processor on the online PC.
python
from transformers import WhisperProcessor, WhisperForConditionalGeneration

# Download teacher model
teacher_model = WhisperForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("openai/whisper-large-v3")
teacher_model.save_pretrained("./models/whisper-large-v3")

# Download student model
student_model = WhisperForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("distil-whisper/distil-large-v3")
student_model.save_pretrained("./models/distil-large-v3")

# Download processor
processor = WhisperProcessor.from_pretrained("openai/whisper-large-v3")
processor.save_pretrained("./models/whisper-large-v3-processor")

    This creates a models/ directory with subfolders whisper-large-v3, distil-large-v3, and whisper-large-v3-processor.

3. Export Conda Environment and Packages

Export the environment specification and download all package tarballs for offline use.
bash
# Export environment YAML
conda env export > asr_distillation.yml

# Export list of packages with exact versions
conda list --export > packages.txt

# Download all Conda package tarballs to a folder
mkdir conda_packages
conda install --download-only -c conda-forge -c pytorch -c nvidia --file packages.txt
# Move downloaded tarballs to conda_packages (location varies by OS)
# On Linux/macOS: typically in ~/miniconda3/pkgs/ or ~/anaconda3/pkgs/
cp ~/miniconda3/pkgs/*.tar.bz2 ./conda_packages/
4. Transfer to Offline PC

    Copy the following to a USB drive or external storage:
        asr_distillation.yml: Environment specification.
        conda_packages/: Folder with all .tar.bz2 package files.
        models/: Folder with pre-downloaded Whisper models and processor.
        Your script (e.g., script.py) and CSV data (your_data.csv).

5. Set Up Environment on Offline PC

Install Conda (e.g., Miniconda) on the offline PC if not already present, then recreate the environment.
bash
# Verify Conda is installed
conda --version

# Create environment from YAML using local packages
conda env create -f asr_distillation.yml --offline --use-local

# Activate the environment
conda activate asr_distillation

# Add local package cache (if not automatically detected)
conda config --append channels file://path/to/conda_packages

# Install any missing packages from tarballs (if needed)
conda install --offline /path/to/conda_packages/*.tar.bz2
6. Update Script for Offline Use

Modify the script to load models and processor from local paths instead of downloading them:
python
# Replace these lines:
processor = WhisperProcessor.from_pretrained("./models/whisper-large-v3-processor")
teacher_model = WhisperForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("./models/whisper-large-v3").to(device)
student_model = WhisperForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("./models/distil-large-v3").to(device)

    Ensure the models/ folder is in the same directory as your script or adjust the paths accordingly.

7. Verify GPU and Run

Check CUDA availability and run the script.
bash
# Verify GPU
python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available(), torch.cuda.current_device(), torch.cuda.get_device_name(0))"
# Expected output: True, 0, <your GPU name, e.g., "NVIDIA RTX 3090">

# Run the script
python script.py
Full Dependency List

Here’s the explicit list of packages (with approximate versions as of March 2025; adjust based on your conda env export output):

    python=3.10
    pytorch=2.1.0 (or latest, with pytorch-cuda=11.8)
    torchaudio=2.1.0
    transformers=4.38.0 (or latest)
    datasets=2.17.0 (or latest)
    pandas=2.2.0 (or latest)
    evaluate=0.4.1 (or latest)
    jiwer=3.0.3 (or latest)
    numpy=1.26.0 (or latest, installed implicitly by PyTorch)

Additional Notes

    CUDA Version: Confirm your offline GPU’s CUDA compatibility (e.g., nvidia-smi output). Adjust pytorch-cuda version (11.8, 12.1, etc.) accordingly on the online PC.
    Storage: The conda_packages/ folder may be ~5–10GB, and models ~10GB (Whisper-large-v3 is ~3GB, Distil-Whisper ~1GB, plus processor files). Ensure your transfer medium has >20GB free.
    Conflicts: Using Conda’s --download-only and --offline flags minimizes conflicts by ensuring exact version matches. If issues persist, manually install problematic packages from conda_packages/.
    GPU Memory: A 20GB GPU (e.g., RTX 3090) can handle Whisper-large-v3 (1.55B params) and Distil-Whisper (300M params) with batch size 4, but reduce to 2 if you encounter OOM errors.

Troubleshooting

    CUDA Error: If torch.cuda.is_available() is False, ensure NVIDIA drivers and CUDA toolkit are installed on the offline PC (download offline installers from NVIDIA’s site beforehand).
    Missing Package: If a dependency fails, check conda_packages/ for the .tar.bz2 file and install it manually with conda install --offline <file>.

This process ensures your offline PC with a 20GB GPU can run the script without dependency conflicts. Let me know if you need further assistance!
